<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

TODO:

## Overview
 
This weeks task was to build a quiz app.  For some reason I have really struggled with this one.

I had to go and see family this weekend, so haven't had anywhere near enough time to work on this.  Sadly I will be submitting what I have, currently incomplete and not fully working at all.  I will have to re-submit this to improve my grade once the logic has been achieved.

I felt like a lot of what we were shown in class this week should of helped me.  But I found it hard to absorb it all this week, I am also not in a good space, conducive to working at all, so it is what it is.

Very disappointed and cannot believe this project beat me.

I started out really strong, developed the timer component in a morning, before even noticing there was a tutorial on it that morning,  I was really proud I figured it out on my own. 

My leaderboard testing - works brilliantly:
- I wanted to make it like an arcade scoreboard; the 'default' players have various names and scores already stored in the array.
- the players score is checked against the leaderboard and if they beat a score, get added to it.

    - add to score
    - newPlayer object is created that holds 3 initials, a score and a playcounter.
    - when score checked, if the player beats the lowest position score, they are asked to enter a username and the player object is successfully added to the array
    - the array correctly sorts positions 
    - if the user makes the highest score, too.

    - It took me 3 days to get those 2 elements down and working correctly.  I spent another morning working on the css and html content; as I wanted to use multiple pages 'start page' 'main-game' and 'leaderboard' and styled each page, very roughly.
